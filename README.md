Jogo da Senha is a code‑breaking game similar to Mastermind: a hidden sequence of colored pins (the "password") is chosen, and the player's goal is to discover both the correct colors and their correct order within a limited number of attempts. On each turn the player builds a guess by selecting a sequence of colored pins and submits it; the game then returns feedback that indicates which pins are the right color in the right position (BLACK) and which pins are the right color but in the wrong position (WHITE). Using that feedback, the player refines subsequent guesses until they either match the secret sequence (win) or exhaust the allowed attempts (lose). In this Java Swing implementation, you interact by clicking colored pin buttons to form guesses and see immediate visual feedback after each submission.
